# Trust and Media Consumption.

The purpose of this project is to analyze the relationship between the variables of media consumption and trust in the media based on the analysis of data from a survey instrument applied to young university students. It also aims to describe the patterns of consumption and trust, looking specifically at the relationship between the level of consumption of digital media and the degree of trust or distrust in them.
